Whenever we open our account on any website we come across a login page
having a login portal. 
```
### Ever imagined how it works!!

java swing gui program.

## You get to know-
```

Use of different tabs like text fields, button, password fields, lable etc.
To set password and username in Java Swing GUI

let your java codes have a better graphical interface!!!
```
### username and password 
```
I have designed a basic login portal for your refrence and the username and
password for my designed portal (whose codes are given above) are-
```
```ruby
USERNAME- siddharththecoder

```
## You can also add a after login page which will open after the verification of username and password

So stay tuned and keep coding.
